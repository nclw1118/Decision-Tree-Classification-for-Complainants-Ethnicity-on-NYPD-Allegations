    "# Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "The prediction question of our project is given the information of all complainants, police officers, and all cases, predict the ethnicity of the complainant. This is a classification problem, because we are trying to classify the result into categories, such as Black, Asian, and etc. The target variable of our project is the ethnicity of complainant, which includes Black, Hispanic, White, Other Race, Asian, and American Indian. Our objective is to use the accuracy to evaluate the model. We want to investigate in how accurate our model will predict a complainant's ethnicity based on the information given in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline Model\n",
    "The features we will use for baseline model are complainant_gender, complainant_age_incident, mos_ethnicity, and fado_type. We will use a total of 4 features to predict the ethnicity of complainant for the basline model. Among the 4 features, 3 features are nominal variables and 1 feature is quantitative variables. We will use OneHotEncoder for all categorical variables to transform them into binary variables and leave the one quantitative variable as it is. Our baseline model has an accuracy of about 0.59. Accuracy comes from the r-squared value. The closer that r-squared value to 1 indicates that our model is better. We think this performance is not very good, there is a huge gap between our r-squared value and 1. However, this performance is not too bad, because at least more than half of our predictions is correct. We could improve the accuracy by building more meaningful features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Model\n",
    "\n",
    "**ADD FEATURE - Duration(length) of Complains.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In our project03, we did a hypothesis test and proved that black complaints were having significantly different complaint duration than others. Therefore we included the new engineered feature-Duration, which enhanced the performance to 0.66.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**ADD FEATURE - Last Name.**\n",
    "\n",
    "we thought that name would be a great indicator of an individual's ethnicity since people from different area of the world has uses different languages of last names and are also likely have different ethnicities. After including last name as another categorical feature, we got R^2 increased to 0.76\n",
    "\n",
    "**DELETE FEATURE - fado_type.**\n",
    "\n",
    "At this step we look back to the baseline parameters again and find the feature fado_type seems like the most irelevant feature associated with ethnicity. After deleting it, we got R^2 increased to about 0.81\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**ADD FEATURE -year_received\\*year_closed**\n",
    "\n",
    "We found that we have only used time data in the engineering feature duration, but time is also an important indicator of the social backgroud so we may consider using it not as durations. We have tried every combinations of features and found year_received\\*year_closed the most reasonable and useful feature to be added. In doing so we enhanced the R^2 to 0.83.\n",
    "\n",
    "**FINAL MODEL:**\n",
    "<li>numerical:</li>\n",
    "       \n",
    "       engineered Length feature\n",
    "       \n",
    "       enginerred year_received year_closed feature\n",
    "       \n",
    "       complainant_age_incident feature\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>categorical:</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "       \"complainant_gender\", \"mos_ethnicity\", and \"last_name\"\n",
    "       \n",
    "At last, we are able to improve our model from R^2 0.59 to 0.83, which we think is a big improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fairness Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inspriation**\n",
    "\n",
    "After observing the value counts for different ethnicities, we found that the black group has much more datapoints than others, which may be a potential threat to our model fairness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Permutation Test**\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we decided to use sensitivity (What proportion of a certain ethnicity were correctly predicted?) as our measurement of fairness to test the difference of recall across black and non-black groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "We used the classic difference-in-means as the test statistic to test the null hypothesis-  sensitivity of the black group is equal to the sensitivity of others, and unsuprisingly got a p-value of 0. Which confirms our first thougtht.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reflection**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the initial dataset we got has overwhelmingly large proportion of black complainants, our model is biased towards the black group. In other words, it is more likely to predict a complainant's ethnicity as black rather than other races."
